# Unifying the Language of AI: A Universal API for Large Language Models
This project aims to break down the barriers between you and the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) by providing a single, unified API to access the capabilities of all major players. Built with the latest Spring Boot 3.2.3 and Spring WebFlux, it offers a seamless and efficient way to interact with various LLMs.

The project leverages Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push responses to the front-end in real-time, mimicking the experience of interacting with popular LLMs like GPT. Additionally, it integrates Swagger 3 to streamline API development and documentation.

For developers, this project also includes a valuable mock service that can be seamlessly integrated into LLM front-end integration tests. This eliminates the need for a real LLM backend during testing, saving time and resources.

## Add More...
* Implemented a Java client to interface with **TREB** (Toronto Regional Real Estate Board) **MLS** (Multiple Listing Service) for pulling selling data based on the IDX protocol.
* Constructed a scheduled batch service to retrieve selling data according to **TREB**'s policy and displayed it on an integrated **Google Map** website.
* Designed and implemented our proprietary image compression algorithm to lower the expenses associated with accessing **Amazon S3**.
* Developed a comprehensive API set using Spring **WebFlux** to efficiently communicate with **OpenAI** endpoints.
* Developed a ChatGPT-like console using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for real-time communication from server to client.
* Leveraged **Spark as a Service** to design and implement a solution for flattening Avro/Json data within a big-data platform. This service enables the transformation of nested data from Kafka and ElasticSearch.
* The flattened data is stored in traditional SQL-friendly tables, with **HDFS** or **Minio** utilized as the persistent layer.
* Additionally, built a data enrichment framework using Spark as a Service to process and transform various data sources into **CDM** (Canonical Data Models).
* Designed and implemented a lightweight scaffold with Spring Boot **Webflux**, **R2DBC** and **MapStruct** to simplify the end-to-end API endpoints development and validation efforts and unify the convention across multiple projects.
